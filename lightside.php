						<p class="wow animated bounceInRight">
							Yoda, a male member of a mysterious species, was a revered Jedi Master who served as the Grand Master of the Jedi Order in the waning days of the Galactic Republic. He was renowned within the Order for his wisdom, powers of the Force, and lightsaber combat, and he lived for nearly 900 years. His time during the last days of the Jedi Order and beyond made him a consequential figure in galactic history.

							Yoda sat on the Jedi High Council during the Invasion of Naboo, when Master Qui-Gon Jinn presented a young slave boy, Anakin Skywalker, and professed his belief that Skywalker was the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. At the same time, it was discovered that the Sith, the age-old enemies of the Jedi, had not gone extinct as the Jedi believed they had. Against Yoda's advice, the Jedi Council agreed that Obi-Wan Kenobi, who became a Jedi Knight after the death of his master, Jinn, could train Skywalker as a Jedi.

						<p class="wow animated bounceInLeft">
							Obi-Wan Kenobi, later known as Ben Kenobi during his exile, was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master who served the Galactic Republic. He was mentor to both Anakin Skywalker and his son, Luke, training them in the ways of the Force.

							Born on the planet Stewjon, Kenobi was taken as the Padawan learner of Qui-Gon Jinn. During the Invasion of Naboo, Kenobi became the first Jedi in a millennium to defeat a Sith Lord when he defeated Darth Maul during the Battle of Naboo, but in that battle, Maul mortally wounded Jinn. At Jinn's behest, Kenobi took Anakin Skywalker to be his own Padawan, training him during the decade leading up to the Clone Wars.

							During the Clone Wars, Skywalker was made a Jedi Knight, and Kenobi and Skywalker fought alongside each other as generals many times.

						<p class="wow animated bounceInRight">
								Mace Windu, a human male, was a Jedi Master and member of the Jedi High Council during the waning days of the Galactic Republic. Born on the planet Haruun Kal, Windu was trained in the Jedi arts as a result of his strong connection to the Force. Ascending to the rank of Master, he became known as the champion of the Jedi Order, an honor he carried for many years until his death. At one point in his career, Windu served as Master of the Order—the elected leader of the Jedi Order.

								Approximately twenty-two years before the Battle of Yavin, Windu witnessed the decline of the Republic as the Separatist Crisis threatened to engulf the galaxy in civil war. The secessionist movement ultimately spawned the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which attempted to secede from the Republic by force. In response to the threat of the Separatist Droid Army, Windu and the Jedi rallied to the defense of the millennia-old democracy as generals of the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic

						<p class="wow animated bounceInleft">
							Qui-Gon Jinn was a male human Jedi Master born on Coruscant during the declining days of the Galactic Republic. Trained by Count Dooku, Jinn was considered a maverick within the Jedi Order, one who did not always follow the Jedi Code; according to his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jinn could have been a member of the Jedi High Council if he had followed the Code. In the years prior to his death, Jinn began studying the secrets of eternal consciousness after death, having long been a student of the Living Force.

							After the Trade Federation blockaded Naboo, Jinn and Kenobi were sent by Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum to negotiate a peaceful outcome to the situation. The Federation, at the behest of Darth Sidious, attempted to kill the two Jedi, forcing Jinn and Kenobi to the planet where the Federation was launching its invasion.

						<p class="wow animated bounceInLeft">
							Luke Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human male Jedi Master who was instrumental in defeating the Galactic Empire and the Sith during the Galactic Civil War. He was the son of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, the paternal grandson of Shmi Skywalker Lars, the maternal grandson of both Ruwee Naberrie and Jobal Naberrie, the step-nephew to Owen and Beru Lars, the twin brother of Leia Organa and the uncle of Ben. Skywalker and his sister were born on the asteroid Polis Massa, unbeknownst to their father, the recently christened Sith Lord Darth Vader. After his mother died in labor, Skywalker was separated from his sister and taken by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to the planet Tatooine to be raised by the Lars family, out of sight of the Galactic Empire.

							Skywalker grew up unaware of his origins, but his life changed forever with his uncle's purchase of two droids—R2-D2 and C-3PO—carrying plans to the Imperial Death Star superweapon.
